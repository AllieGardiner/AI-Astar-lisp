# AI-Astar-lisp
A* algorithm with 8-puzzle, and cannibals and missionaries problems with common lisp version 2.44.
In order to ensure that the code will work properly, the state space scripts (i.e. 8-puzzle.lisp, or cannibals.lisp) must be in the same directory as their accompanying a-star implementations (i.e. a-star-8-puzzle.lisp,and a-star-cannibals.lisp).
